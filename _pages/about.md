I am a Ph.D. candidate enrolled in 2023 in the Department of Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Shanfang Huang](https://www.ep.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1166/2373.htm). My research focuses on nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics and multi-physics coupling. To date, I have published 5 first-author papers in journals such as Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physical Review E, and Applied Thermal Engineering. I have presided over two National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Programs. I have been awarded the Tsinghua Future Scholar Scholarship for doctoral students, received the National Scholarship for Graduate Students twice (2024, 2025), and was selected for the first cohort of the China Association for Science and Technology Young Talent Support Program (Doctoral Special Project).
