Helium-xenon gas mixture (He-Xe) and tight rod bundles are widely used in gas-cooled space nuclear reactors. However, few studies have been conducted on the effects of pitch-to-diameter ratio (\\( P/D \\)) on thermal-hydraulic characteristics while considering conjugate heat transfer. This paper numerically investigated He-Xe heat transfer in a fuel-gas gap-cladding-coolant structure of tight rod bundles. The numerical model is validated using experimental data and the maximum error of wall temperature is less than \\( 5\% \\). The results show that conjugate heat transfer significantly affects the heat transfer. The heat transfer coefficient without conjugate heat transfer is only \\( 8.85\% \\) of that with conjugate heat transfer in the quasi-triangular pipe. The decrease in \\( P/D \\) enhances the convective heat transfer and causes larger transfer pressure drops. A new performance evaluation criterion (PEC) is presented considering the effects of heat transfer, pressure drop and volume. PEC first increases and then decreases with the increase in \\( P/D \\) and the best comprehensive performance occurs at \\( P/D = 1.113 \\). The analysis of the temperature difference in the viscous sublayer (\\( y^+ < 5 \\)) shows that the decrease in \\( P/D \\) enhances the turbulent effect of He-Xe and reduces the thickness of the viscous sublayer, resulting in the heat transfer enhancement. This study contributes to the optimal design of advanced space reactors.
